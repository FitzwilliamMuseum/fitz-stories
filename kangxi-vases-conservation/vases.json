The vases' interiors are glazed but otherwise unadorned. The quality of the painting varies. The larger fields of coloured enamels on the baluster jar (but not its lid) are thick and clumsily applied, in places obscuring the patterns of the underglaze blue and subtle black outlines of the enamel designs, suggesting this piece may have been completed by a junior worker. Other mistakes are also apparent (see Retouching). In contrast, its lid and the yan yan vases are skilfully painted.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHard-paste porcelain is a type of white ceramic body made from a special mixture of predominantly kaolin (China clay) and petuntse (China stone, a feldspathic rock) that has been fired in a kiln to a very high temperature (1200-1450Â°C/2192-2642Â°F). This causes the ceramic to become very hard, brittle, glassy and slightly translucent. (One can see through a very thin piece of porcelain if it is held up to the light).

The shapes, curvatures and diameters of the three vases are all slightly different. So too are the underglaze and overglaze designs and the colour schemes, for example the rim and foot patterns differ on the two yan yan vases. The conservator uses these clues to match pieces and and put them together. The thicknesses also vary greatly - from 3cm near the base of the largest jar to less than 1cm near the rims. Pieces of the lid, flat bases and glazed rims were very easy to identify. The recovery system used meant that many of these were found adjacent to each other in the relevant grid squares/trays. The neck and base of the baluster vase that had sat on the left of the sill were largely intact.</p><p>The quality of the painting also varies. The painted enamels on the largest baluster jar is much coarser than that on the other pots (see Disaster!!) and the painted leaves only have one tone of green. In contrast, the yan yan vases and the baluster vase lid have both dark and pale greens. Penny occasionally referred to old photographs to examine details of the designs. Her years of experience meant she quickly mastered all three 3D jigsaws. At this stage, she also identified found the positions of many, though not all, of the smaller surface fragments.<br></p><p>From the reconstruction. Penny discovered that much of the surface design was intact and, except for the impact points, there were very few areas so damaged that they were beyond recovery. Some of the pieces had completely disintegrated, leaving holes. When she had finished, she was able to determine how many holes would need filling.

This is very important. If the fragments are put back together in the wrong sequence, some can be 'locked out' by their neighbours and can't be inserted. When this happens, the joins must be dismantled back to the point where the locked-out sherd can be included, then built back up again. The conservator constantly has to think ahead.</p><p>For large ceramics broken into many pieces, even an experienced conservator finds some tricky areas require several attempts before finding the correct sequence. You can see this happening for real in the time-lapse film of the reassembly of a yan yan vase, especially around the point of impact. (See Reassembly)<br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Possible complications: Springing</b></p><p>The temporary reassembly also confirmed that most of the vases had not 'sprung' as had been feared. Ceramics fired at high temperatures, such as porcelain, are often under tension. These stresses can be released when the object is broken. The fragments literally 'spring' apart and curves straighten out, making accurate reassembly almost impossible. Springing may affect a ceramic to such an extent that the distorted sherds cannot be realigned without applying considerable force (for example, using clamps) and sometimes not at all. This can complicate the restoration. Some conservators consider reshaping under tension unethical, because it reintroduces stresses that may cause new breaks in other areas. In these instances, the mismatched gap is filled to strengthen and stabilise the ceramic. It may be possible to disguise a narrow gap by retouching, but larger gaps will always look slightly strange.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, one portion had sprung slightly. The top of one of the yan yan vases (originally positioned left on the sill) had separated as an almost complete fragment. A vertical crack down one side of the neck had sprung open by half a millimetre. Taping brought the edges of the join almost completely back together but the join was not perfect and had to be filled like other cracks.</p><p><br></p><p><b>What tape did she use to make the temporary joins?</b></p><p>Penny used a colourless transparent plastic self-adhesive tape, ('sticky tape') of the kind found in most stationers. This has sufficient strength and grab to temporarily support the heavy sherds.</p><p><br></p><p><b>How did she apply the tape?</b></p><p>It is important to position the tape properly when taping up joins or the fragments will not be supported and may sag. A ninety-degree angle across the join gives the greatest strength. The tape is pulled tight across the fragments. Tape is not applied over fragile areas of surface decoration, such as flaking enamels or gilding, although this is unavoidable for some small fragments. The tape can be peeled off cleanly from areas of intact glaze with the assistance of acetone. Any residues are also removed with acetone.</p><p><b>Where were the 'points of impact' on the vases? How many were there?</b></p><p>Areas which sustained the greatest damage, especially the 'point of impact' â the part which first hit the ground and took the weight of the fall â were often extremely fragmentary, with many losses. They are usually on the widest point of the vase, i.e. on the shoulders of the yan yan vases, the upper body of the baluster vase and the curve of the lid.</p><p>These were particularly difficult to reassemble. In some cases, for example on the baluster jar, the decorated outer surface had exploded into miniscule fragments and the thick porcelain wall splintered into wafer thin slices. Pieces of a reasonable size only survived on the inner surface. These had been fractured by typical star-shaped crack pattern that radiated out from the centre of the impact point. On the yan yan vases and the lid, even this inner wall was too fragmented to reconstruct, leaving each with a large hole in its side. The first vase that toppled (a yan yan) had two points of impact, one on either side of the body.<br></p>"}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Cleaning","id":"23","title":"<p>Cleaning<br></p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p>The fragments were soaked in a plastic bowl of hot water and washing powder for 20 minutes.

Finally, excess water was blotted off and the sherds left dry in a warm place.

The time-lapse in the interactive shows the actual complete reassembly of the most damaged yan yan vase (120 main fragments) from start to finish. It took 8 hours.

It does not shrink when it hardens. Epoxy resins are very strong, hard adhesives. Conservation-grade epoxies are suitable for repairing hard non-porous ceramics such as hard-paste porcelains. They are not appropriate for weaker or porous ceramics such as earthenware. HXTALâ¢ NYL-1 was chosen because it has better ageing characteristics than some of the other available conservation-grade epoxy resin adhesives. The cured translucent resin also has a similar refractive index to the glazes on hard-paste porcelain. It is this quality that makes cracks seem to disappear when it is applied.<br></p><p>The HXTALâ¢ NYL-1 is a 2-part liquid adhesive measured by weight in a 3:1 ratio. If not mixed accurately the adhesive will not set and the bonds may fail. The components were weighed out exactly, drop-wise on scales, before mixing thoroughly. A small metal sculptor's spatula was used to mix the adhesive and apply it to the taped cracks.<br></p><p>HXTALâ¢ NYL-1 has one principle drawback. The adhesive takes two weeks to harden. There is a risk that dirt will settle onto the wet surface, causing staining.

In conservation timescales, good stability and reversibility means ideally using materials that will not discolour and remain reversible for a minimum of 100 years under museum conditions. This is not possible for most epoxy resins currently on the market. Most adhesives age and discolour faster if regularly exposed to strong light and heat, such as direct sunlight. Oddly, there is also evidence that some epoxy resins need some light to prevent them from discolouring, so repaired objects should not be stored in total dark, such as a cupboard.</p>"}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Filling the Losses","id":"29","title":"<p>Filling the Losses</p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p><b>What materials were used to make the fills?Â </b>The adhesive was the same 2-part epoxy resin, HXTALâ¢ NYL-1, used to bond the fragments (see Bonding). Fumed silica was used as the bulking agent mixed into it. Fumed silica is opaque, white, very finely ground and chemically inert.</p><p><b>Which pigments were used to colour match the filler to the blue glaze?Â </b>4 powder pigments were mixed to match the glaze: titanium white, cerulean blue, raw umber and yellow ochre. Each was first mixed separately on a white tile with a small amount of the filler, then combined. The choice of pigments and the exact amounts used to achieve a colour match with the glaze are determined by experience. The colour of the glaze may vary, even on a single object. Each area must be matched using different batches of filler.</p><p><b>Were all the fills made in the same way?Â </b>No. The conservator used two different types of fill on the vases. The smaller losses and cracks were all filled with HXTALâ¢ NYL-1 and fumed silica. However, a very few large losses that went through the thickness of the walls, such as the points of impact, required a slightly different approach.</p><p>HXTALâ¢ NYL-1/fumed silica filler is, by itself, too translucent and brittle to make a robust thick fill and could fail if stressed. So these fills were given a little extra strength by making an inner layer of a slightly flexible material. These were prepared in two stages. First UHUâ¢ Plus, another epoxy resin with slightly greater flexibility and opacity, was kneaded with French chalk and titanium powder pigment to make a second filler.</p><p>A thin layer was inserted into the centre of the hole to make the core of the fill. It also acted as a backing layer for the rest of the fill. UHUâ¢ Plus yellows faster than HXTAL, but this is not a problem as it is covered on both sides and would not be seen. Once hardened, the core fill was covered on both sides with the more translucent HXTALâ¢ NYL-1 filler, prepared as usual.</p><p><b>What tools and materials were used to rub down the surface?Â </b>The following abrasives were all used on each fill, starting with the coarsest and proceeding to the finest, finishing with micro-crystalline wax.

A few of these areas can be identified when seen close up. Some restorers completely cover their fills by spraying on the retouching paints. Usually the spray extends on either side of the fill to blend in with the original surface. This makes the repair 'invisible' but also covers up some of the original object. This method tends to disguise the restoration and may deceive the viewer.
