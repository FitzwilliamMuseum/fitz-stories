When they were returned and properly examined, it became clear that both trophies were not up to museum-standard cleanliness and needed some serious TLC before going on display.

Later on, the white stripe was dropped in favour of solid blue for the racing jerseys.

This explains why they wore brown shorts with their white jerseys: NCBC’s colours were dark brown with gold trim, popularly referred to as ‘mud and mustard’! </p>\r\n\r\n"}},{"slideshowhorizontal":{"nav_title":"Figure 11 - 12","suppress":"on","id":"25","title":"","files":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"images":[{"title":"Margaret Teify Rhys (‘Tiffy’), the 1927 Cambridge Women’s cox sporting her ‘mud and mustard’ blazer, surrounded by her crew wearing the shorts known as Oxford ‘bags’;","credits":"<p>Blah</p>","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b-isdn-26-march-1927-1.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b-isdn-26-march-1927-1.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b-isdn-26-march-1927-1.jpg"},{"title":"A set of Newnham brown shorts, tailored by Bodgers, and worn by Ruth Bonney, who rowed for CUWBC in 1953-6.","credits":"<p><br></p>","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/1955rbshortsframe4.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/1955rbshortsframe4.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/1955rbshortsframe4.jpg"}]}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Rowing historians","suppress":"on","id":"26","title":"","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p>And it also explains why many – including Cambridge rowing historians Carol Williams and Jane Kingsbury who co-authored <i>Cambridge University Women’s Boat Club 1941–2014</i>, The Struggle against Inequality – prefer to regard 1941 as the first true Women’s Boat Race, when the newly-founded <a href=\"http://cuwbchistory.org/historic-photos/2010s-photos-videos\" target=\"_blank\">CUWBC raced OUBC</a> for the first time. </p><p>As Carol told me, </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“According to Cambridge views, the 1927–1939 women's races were not true Boat Races since at Cambridge only Newnham raised a crew and hence it was a race of a college versus OUBC (founded in 1926) (CUWBC was not founded until 1941).  I explained this to Claire Balding before the 2015 Boat Race but the BBC have insisted on using 1927 as the date of the first Boat Race. ;You will see that this makes quite a large difference in the overall statistics. If you start from 1941, then Cambridge has won the Women’s Boat Race 43 time to Oxford’s 23.”</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Frustratingly for Carol and Jane, Cambridge University Boat Club considers 1927 to be the date of the first Women’s Boat Race which is why the records start with this on the base of the Newton Women’s Trophy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is frequently stated that The Times recorded how ‘large and hostile crowds gathered on the towpath’. But this is an urban myth as rowing historian <a href=\"https://heartheboatsing.com/2020/12/21/the-first-oxbridge-womens-boat-race-emulating-the-pale-and-dark-blue-lords-of-creation/\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Koch’s blog</a> makes clear. Although the University authorities tried to discourage crowds (according to the Western Morning News: <strong>‘The authorities at Oxford do not like the idea of a large crowd of men students being present in a spirit of idle curiosity, so the race will start at 1:15 p.m., in the hope that the conflict with the lunch hour will keep spectators away’</strong>), this failed miserably. Indeed, according to the report of The Sheffield Independent,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><p>‘There was an enormous crowd on the towpath, and enthusiastic undergraduates flung confetti and streamers over the river and blew toy trumpets along the towpath. In the general melee one of the judges twice fell off his bicycle.’ </p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Ridiculous as it sounds now, the two female crews were not permitted on the river at the same time, so rather than having a side-by-side contest like their male counterparts, the race was to be decided on points awarded by the two coaches for ‘speed’ and ‘style’ (the latter defined as ‘steadiness, finish, rhythm and other matters of style’) with each crew rowing down-stream for style and back again for speed. Since the coaches couldn’t agree on the matter of style, the competition was settled purely on speed with Oxford winning, having rowed the course in 3 minutes 26 seconds, 14 seconds faster than Cambridge.\r\n </p>"}},{"slideshowvertical":{"nav_title":"The Cambridge Women’s Crew rowing on the Isis in the first ever Women’s Boat Race, 1927","suppress":"on","id":"27","title":"","files":["","","","","",""],"images":[{"title":"The Cambridge Women’s Crew rowing on the Isis in the first ever Women’s Boat Race, 1927\r\n\r\n","credits":"","srcphone":"https://heartheboatsing.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/2a-womens-br-15-mar-1927-cambridge.jpg","srcmedium":"https://heartheboatsing.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/2a-womens-br-15-mar-1927-cambridge.jpg","srcmain":"https://heartheboatsing.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/2a-womens-br-15-mar-1927-cambridge.jpg"}]}},{"youtube":{"id":"28","nav_title":"Trial VIII video","suppress":"on","youtube_id":"xDJFi5CDUiI","controls":"on","autoAdvance":"on"}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"An ongoing struggle for sporting equality ","id":"29","light":"on","title":"<p>An ongoing struggle for sporting equality&nbsp;<br></p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p>The next seven Women’s (or NCBC v OUWBC) Boat Races occurred intermittently between 1929 and 1939 and were rowed in various locations (Cam, Isis, Tideway, and Thames). In 1936, the contest became side-by side for the first time. As Carol Williams explained to me: </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“After 1941, which I consider the first true Women’s Boat Race, the contest was held in 1942 and then each year from 1944 until 1948.&nbsp;Then, due to an unfortunate accident of the Oxford women allowing one of their boats to go over a weir, the crew were banned from rowing on the Isis for a decade.”\r\n</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not until 1964 that the Women’s Boat Race became an annual event, and even then, the ‘Sweaty Betties’ (as the Cambridge women rowers were called) were not permitted to wear Light Blue. As Averil Wootton (who rowed for CUWBC from 1964–66) recalled,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“We were not allowed to use Varsity blue; instead of that particular shade of duckegg/pale turquoise it had to be Sky blue, the standard light blue of the time. Moreover, I assume, just to make the point that we were nothing to do with the Blue Boat, we had a white stripe across the blade. To me, it suggested a Bar Sinister, with the suggestion of illegitimacy.”</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1977, the Women’s Boat Race moved to Henley (where the Men’s Lightweight Race was already established) and was conducted along a 1.2&nbsp;mile (2 km) stretch of river, from the Henley Royal Regatta&nbsp;finish to Temple Island. In 1981, Sue Brown became the first woman to compete in the Men’s Boat Race, as the cox for Oxford, steering them to victory by 8 lengths (see Fig. 18). Carole Burton became the first woman to cox a Cambridge Men’s Boat in 1986, likewise steering her crew to victory, with a 7-length margin (see Fig. 19).</p>\r\n"}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"The tide turns in favour of sporting parity","id":"30","title":"The tide turns in favour of sporting parity","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p>Calls for the Women’s Boat Race to be put on an equal footing with the Men’s grew ever louder.

The critical role of Newton’s CEO, Helena Morrissey was clarified by Tim Koch in his insightful Boat Race sponsorship blog of January 2016:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>‘As has often been the case with such deals, there is one remarkable individual that is the driving force behind the massive support that Newton has given to the women. In this case it is Newton’s CEO, Helena Morrissey, one of the founders of the 30 Per Cent Club, which is committed to bringing more women on to UK corporate boards.

There was no ceremony after the Race and the crews simply got out of the boats and a few individuals were interviewed.

For the 1977 Boat Race (their sponsorship had gone up to £10,000), they commissioned a trophy and medals for both the winners and the losers. I don’t know how long the Losers’ Medals lasted as they were deeply unpopular, mainly because Cambridge kept being awarded them, and the 1978 Cambridge crew even threw theirs into the Thames!”</p></blockquote><p>Nor have I been able to find out who designed and made the rather poignant silver relief of the exhausted rower shown post-Race, slumped over in the seat with head bowed and hands off the oar.

My answer? Hell yes! We jointly agreed that it needed to be inspired by the very fluid shape of the boats, oars and riggers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My sister was rowing for Monmouth at the time so I met her on several occasions to get a better understanding of what’s involved in rowing and to study the shape of the boats and blades. I wanted the trophy to be tall and sleek with an overall design that is elegant and stream-lined. This led to the Quaich’s two handles being inspired by the riggers, and the supports being made in the form of oars.”\r\n</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p> Rachel recalls:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>\r\n“In order to visibly herald the winner, I devised two different and easy-to-attach finials for the lid of the Quaich, in the shape of a heraldic animal associated with the respective Universities and their boat clubs: a lion for Cambridge and an ox for Oxford. If Cambridge wins, the lion finial is quickly screwed in place, but if Oxford wins, then it is replaced with the ox.” </p><p>By holding the finial, you can remove the lid to reveal the interior of the Quaich. Following a suggestion of Mr Clegg from the Boat Race Committee, the inside was engraved with a map recording the Championship Course. It’s great fun to see people’s faces when they take the lid off and they discover this unexpected element hidden inside.</p></blockquote>"}},{"slideshowvertical":{"nav_title":"Figures 26 and 27","suppress":"on","id":"46","title":"","files":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"images":[{"title":"Detail of the Quaich showing inscription recording Rachel Hopkins as the designer","credits":"© Fitzwilliam Museum, Mike Jones","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mens-boat_maker_202109_mfj22_dc1-1-.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mens-boat_maker_202109_mfj22_dc1-1-.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mens-boat_maker_202109_mfj22_dc1-1-.jpg"},{"title":"Rachel Hopkins admiring the Aberdeen Asset Management Trophy at The Boat Race in 2000, when it was first awarded\r\n","credits":"© Rachel Hopkins","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/rachel_hopkins_trophy.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/rachel_hopkins_trophy.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/rachel_hopkins_trophy.jpg"}]}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Making the trophy","id":"47","light":"on","title":"<p>Making the trophy</p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p> In terms of how she actually made the design, Rachel told me, </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“I initially sketched shapes and ideas and then drew it up on the computer. I then hand-painted the final drawings and presented full-scale ideas to Aberdeen Asset Management. I think I gave them four options in total. They liked all of them but in the end chose the one they preferred.” </p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Converting the two-dimensional design into a three-dimensional object involved many other skilled silversmiths, as Rachel revealed: </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“Once the final design had been agreed on, I prepared scaled-up technical drawings for Nicholas Winton and his team to work to. I had no part in converting these into the silver cup: that was left to his silversmiths who used the whole range of silversmithing techniques – spinning, smithing, forming, and scoring, engraving and polishing. It was really lovely that they also included my name in tiny letters at the bottom, as it was such an honour to be able to work on the trophy for this iconic rowing race, which I’ve loved watching since I was a kid.” </p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I quizzed Nicholas Winton about the materials and techniques used. Nick recalled how, </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“the trophy was made from sterling silver with the Quaich and sheet areas being spun, and the finials and the oars cast. The spinnings and castings were combined with the smithing to create the Quaich, and then the cup was carefully engraved with all the historic records from 1829 until 1999. Each record had to include the date, the name of the winning crew, and the winning margin. Before final polishing, we added the obligatory <a href=\"https://www.nicholaswinton.co.uk/hallmarks/\" target=\"_blank\">hallmarks</a>: my maker’s mark (my initials ‘NW’); the lion passant (indicating that the material used is sterling silver), the number ‘925’ (the modern convention mark for sterling silver); the leopard’s head (indicating that the place of production was London) and the letter ‘a’ (the date letter for 2000, the year of manufacture). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole process, from start to finish, took about 18 weeks. It was a pleasure to be involved in such a high-profile commission, and wonderful to be invited to the 2000 Boat Race by the sponsors, when the Quaich was inaugurated. Although Aberdeen is no longer the sponsor, with Xchanging, BNY Mellon and now Gemini getting involved, the cup they commissioned is still being awarded, which is wonderful, and it’s a thrill to see it being presented year in, year out.” </p></blockquote>"}},{"slideshowhorizontal":{"nav_title":"Figure 28","suppress":"on","id":"48","title":"","files":["","","","","",""],"images":[{"title":"The Aberdeen Asset Management Men’s Boat Race Trophy, commissioned from Nicholas Winton and designed by Rachel Hopkins, 2000\r\n","credits":"© Fitzwilliam Museum, Mike Jones","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mens-boat_ribs2_202109_mfj22_dc1-1-.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mens-boat_ribs2_202109_mfj22_dc1-1-.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mens-boat_ribs2_202109_mfj22_dc1-1-.jpg"}]}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"The Women’s Silver Trophies","id":"49","title":"<p>The Women’s Silver Trophies<br></p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p>\r\nAs far as can be ascertained, there have also been three different trophies for the Women’s Boat Race, but this was due to temporary misplacement rather than changes in sponsorship.

We then had lengthy discussions about a design brief. I had previously designed and made several horse-racing trophies and had the confidence that the design would be a great success. I was given plenty of time to develop ideas and finally made a presentation to the small committee that had been formed to oversee the Women’s Boat Race Trophy. This comprised of Annamarie Phelps on behalf of CUWBC, Annabel Eyres on behalf of OUWBC and Clare Blackmore on behalf of Newton. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, they all loved the designs I had come up with, so we agreed a timetable and a budget, and I started work on the trophy. Newton were very supportive all the way along the journey from conception to completion as they really understood what designing and making a trophy involves. They were a wonderful company to work with, and sent me a lovely warm rowing fleece and chocolates to keep me going in the workshop during the cold winter months, and they even commissioned a Lego model of my design as a surprise!”</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe design process for the Women’s trophy was another highly successful collaboration between the sponsors, the two University Boat Clubs and the silversmith, with everyone having the chance to input ideas over the 18-month period it took to make the cup. Rod recalls how, </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“The Universities were asked for their comments, and feedback was given to Newton who then relayed the observations to me. I wanted to get a feel for rowing and the boats, and so I met with the two Captains, and I was invited to join a Light Blue training session. Despite it being at 6am on a very cold autumn morning, it was an amazing experience, and I realised just what sacrifices they made to rowing. They caught the first train to Ely, jogged to the Rowing Club hut, used dire changing facilities to change, took to the river with their expensive hulls, and worked out on the water with the coach in the freezing cold. They then had a quick change, no shower and were back on the train for a 9am lecture. That was real commitment, and three times a week. Understanding all of this, just added to the privilege of being asked to make a Trophy that would be awarded each year to the winning crew, and act as a focus for their celebrations.” </p></blockquote>"}},{"slideshowhorizontal":{"nav_title":"Figures 34 and 35","suppress":"on","id":"56","title":"","files":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"images":[{"title":"<p>The Lego model of Rod Kelly’s Women’s Boat Race Trophy<br></p>","credits":"<p>Copyright Rod Kelly</p>","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lego-model-of-rod-s-trophy.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lego-model-of-rod-s-trophy.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lego-model-of-rod-s-trophy.jpg"},{"title":"<p>The cup element of the Women’s Boat Race Trophy on Rod Kelly’s workbench being formed and hammered<br></p>","credits":"<p>Copyright Rod Kelly<br></p>","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/trophy_being_made.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/trophy_being_made.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/trophy_being_made.jpg"}]}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Materials","id":"57","title":"<p>Materials</p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p> In terms of the materials, form and iconographic elements used in the trophy, Rod told me, </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“I’ve always used sterling silver. It’s nice and hard and responsive, and lovely to chase. I deliberately chose a square shape for the trophy, rather than a more traditional round one, because from whichever angle you view it from, it always catches the light. Each square side panel was formed and hammered by hand with a slight curve in it. Rising from the bottom of each is a thin pointed shape recalling the bow of a rowing boat, surrounded by swirling lines, chased in to represent the flow of water as the hull cuts through. The four ebony columns represent the oars.” \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> \r\nRod continued: </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>“The base is chased with symbols representing the parties involved.

The other two sides are decorated with two apples and weighing scales which both represents the sponsors Newton as Investment Bankers and is a tongue in cheek reference to Isaac Newton. As with many pieces of silver I have made, the inside has a gilt finish, which makes it look very rich and elegant.”</p></blockquote><p>The construction was evidently tricky and time-consuming with Rod confiding,</p><blockquote><p>“The square body was made in four sections and soldered together. All of the component parts were made from flat sheet 1.1 mm thick, folded, hammered and soldered to produce the required shapes. As I have made many pieces before and had spent several hours working out exactly how it would be made it was really just a case of following a plan and executing each piece perfectly. If it does not work first time you have to take it apart and get it right! I had previously made a model in paper card and wood. The base is also made from 1.1 mm sheet, shaped and soldered together.

If so, be sure to visit the Fitz before Monday 28 March 2022, when they leave Cambridge and head over to the Thames for Boat Race Day 2022 (Sunday 3 April), as depending on who wins, we may only be getting one trophy back, or none at all!\r\n</p><p>And if you want to know what the rowers think of the trophies, check out: “Trophy Talk: Rowers Reflections on The Boat Race Trophies”.\r\n</p>"}},{"slideshowvertical":{"nav_title":"Fig 40","suppress":"on","id":"62","title":"","files":["","","","","",""],"images":[{"title":"Rod Kelly together with the winning Oxford Women’s crew proudly holding up the Newton Trophy at the 2014 Boat Race when it was first awarded\r\n","credits":"© Rod Kelly","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/rod_with_crew.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/rod_with_crew.jpg","srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/rod_with_crew.jpg"}]}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Acknowledgements","id":"63","light":"on","title":"<p>Acknowledgements</p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p>Huge thanks to everyone who helped me in the preparation of this blog, especially silversmiths Rachel Hopkins, Rod Kelly and Nicholas Winton and the sporting contingent: </p><p>Nick Brooking (Director of Sport, University of Cambridge Sports Centre), Siobhan Cassidy and Charlotte Jackson as well as Robert Gillespie and David Searle (Boat Race Company Ltd) and other former Blues rowers and Boat Race experts: Jane Kingsbury, Annamarie Phelps, Carol Williams as well as Donald Legget and Alister Taylor. </p><p>And many thanks to all my wonderful colleagues at the Fitzwilliam Museum for their help with the display and its promotion: </p><p>Lynda Clark, Jo Dillon, Lily Griffin, Mike Jones, My Linh Le, Andrew Maloney, Tim Matthews, Dan Pett, Darren Potter, Helena Rodwell, Sophie Rowe, Elena Saggers, Emma Shaw, Neal Spencer, Luke Syson, Phil Wheeler and Nik Zolman.\r\n</p>"}},{"imageparallax":{"id":"64","suppress":true,"format":{"fullpage":true},"nav_title":"Celebration ","title":"","subtitle":"","image":{"srcmain":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsc_2449.jpg","srcmedium":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsc_2449.jpg","srcphone":"https://fitz-cms-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dsc_2449.jpg"}}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"Further reading and links","id":"65","title":"<p>Further reading and links</p>","files":["","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"                    <p>\r\n                      For The Boat Race and its history: <a href=\"https://www.theboatrace.org/\">The Boat Race</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boat_Race\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a><br>\r\n                      For Jane Kingsbury and Carol Williams, <a href=\"http://cuwbchistory.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge University Women’s Boat Club 1941–2014, The Struggle against Inequality</a><br>\r\n                      For the first men’s <a href=\"https://www.westminster.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cambridge-Pink-Boat-of-1829.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Boat Race of 1829 and Cambridge’s Pink Boat</a><br>\r\n                      For the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xDJFi5CDUiI\" target=\"_blank\">time trials of 2021</a><br>\r\n                      For the next <a href=\"https://www.theboatrace.org/news/the-boat-race-returns-to-london-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\">Boat Race on Sunday 3 April 2022</a><br>\r\n                      For Cambridge University Boat Club (formed in 2020): <a href=\"https://cubc.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cubc.org.uk/</a> <a href=\"https://cubc.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><br>\r\n                      For Oxford University Boat Club (men only): <a href=\"https://oubc.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">https://oubc.org.uk/</a><br>\r\n                      For Oxford University Women’s Boat Club: <a href=\"https://ouwbc.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ouwbc.org.uk/</a><br>\r\n                      For a list of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cambridge_University_Boat_Race_crews\" target=\"_blank\">men’s Cambridge University Boat Race Crews</a><br>\r\n                      For a list of the <a href=\"http://cuwbchistory.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge University Women’s Boat Race Crews</a> <br>\r\n                      For a list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oxford_University_Boat_Race_crews\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford University Boat Race Crews</a><br>\r\n                      For a history of <a href=\"https://heartheboatsing.com/2016/01/20/rebranding-the-boat-race/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsorship of The Boat Race</a>\r\n                    </p>"}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"End slide","suppress":"on","id":"66","light":"on","title":"<p><br></p>","files":["","","","",""],"subtitle":"","intro":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(83, 100, 113);
