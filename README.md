# Long form stories

This repository holds code for long form stories from the Fitzwilliam Museum.

We are using @GetMural [Mural package](https://github.com/GetMural/Mural) to generate our stories, with all images included as urls pointing to our content management system provided by Directus.

The static code generated from the zip file you download is placed in a folder that
